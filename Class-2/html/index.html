	<p>This is a paragraph. A paragraph is a short description or overview on a topic. This should be followed in a standard way to explain something.</p>
	<p>A paragraph is a group of words put together to form a group that is usually longer than a <b>sentence</b>. <strong>Paragraphs</strong> are often made up of several sentences. There are usually between three and eight sentences. Paragraphs can begin with an indentation (about five spaces), or by missing a line out, and then starting again. This makes it easier to see when one paragraph ends and another begins.</p>

	<p>This is another  <em>Italic</em> </p>
	
	<p>
		In most organized forms of writing, such as essays,<mark> paragraphs contain a topic sentence</mark>. </br> This topic sentence of the paragraph tells the reader what the paragraph will be about.</br> Essays usually have multiple paragraphs that make claims to support a thesis statement, which is the central idea of the essay.
